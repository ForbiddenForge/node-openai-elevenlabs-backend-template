## Setup

Create a `.env` file at the root of the repository to add your **OpenAI** and **ElevenLabs API Keys**. Refer to `.env.example` for the environment variable names.

Download the **RhubarbLibrary** binary for your **OS** [here](https://github.com/DanielSWolf/rhubarb-lip-sync/releases) and put it in your `bin` folder. The `rhubarb` executable should be accessible through `bin/rhubarb`.
